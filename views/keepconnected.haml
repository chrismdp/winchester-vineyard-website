        %p Like many other churches, we’ve had to make some changes during this season. Our church has not closed, but we are meeting in different ways!  We’re keeping this page as up to date as possible to help you stay connected with our core activities.  
        %h2 new to church
        %p
          We’d love to get to know you over a phone call or a virtual coffee. Please do 
          %a{:href => 'mailto:hello@winvin.org.uk'} email the office 
          and we will arrange a telephone or zoom call with one of our team. You can also view our Welcome pack and give us your details

        %h2 sundays
        %p 
          You can tune in to our Facebook Page every Sunday morning: Kids Church is at 10:00 and the grown ups meet at 10:30 on our
          %a{:href => 'https://www.facebook.com/winchestervineyardchurch/'} Facebook Page
          where you will be able to comment and engage live. If you are not able to watch on facebook head to
          %a{:href => 'http://www.winvin.org.uk/live/'} winvin.org.uk/live.
          Catch up with the service or just the talk or worship afterwards on our 
          %a{:href => 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrz4VsDe4tuh3A8IhWT7ztA/'} WV YouTube channel

        %p
          Life groups have always been our key places to connect during the week and even though they are meeting digitally rather than physically they remain vital in this season.  Most groups are staying connected through WhatsApp chats and video calls. If you are not in a group, it’s not too late to join one! Check out our
          %a{:href => '../lifegroups'} Life Group list here!

        %h2 youth
        %p
          We believe it is so important that our young people stay connected and engaged through this challenging, unprecedented season. We are meeting on zoom twice a week - Sundays at 11:30am and Thursdays at 7pm. As well as this we are also hosting youth small groups which meet throughout the week. We also have an instagram group chat - follow us

          to be added! All of this information has been emailed to parents - if you have any questions please email

        %h2 kids
        %p
          We want to make sure our children can remain engaged! Kids Church Online at 10am has worship, Bible stories and activities. A range of colouring and activity funsheets and other suggested resources are being sent out to parents each week - and we have created a new private 
          %a{:href => 'https://www.facebook.com/groups/winchestervineyardkids/'} facebook page 
          for parents to connect. We will be sharing fun interactive activities for you and your kids to get involved with - see the email from Louise for all details.
        %h2 resources
        %p
          Our Sunday follow up links and resources, along with some other helpful material for times of prayer or devotion can all be found on our
          %a{:href => 'https://www.winvin.org.uk/resources/'} Resources page.
