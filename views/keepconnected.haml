        %p Like many other churches, we’ve had to make some changes during this season. Our church has not closed, but we are meeting in different ways!  We’re keeping this page as up to date as possible to help you stay connected with our core activities.

          We’d love to get to know you over a phone call or a virtual coffee. Please do call or email the office and we will arrange a telephone or zoom call with one of our team.
        %h2 lifegroups
        %p
          Life groups have always been our key places to connect during the week and even though they are meeting digitally rather than physically they remain vital in this season.  Most groups are staying connected through WhatsApp chats and video calls. If you are not in a group, it’s not too late to join one! Check out our lifegroup list

        %p
          We want to make sure our children can remain engaged! A range of colouring and activity funsheets and other suggested resources are being sent out to parents each week - and we have created a new private 
          %a{:href => 'https://www.facebook.com/groups/winchestervineyardkids/'} facebook page 
          for parents to connect. We will be sharing fun interactive activities for you and your kids to get involved with - see the email from Louise for all details.
