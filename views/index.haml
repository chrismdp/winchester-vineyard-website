        %h1 sundays - what to expect
        %p You are really welcome to join us on a Sunday morning whether you are a church regular or have never been before. Our service starts at 10.30am and finishes at 12 noon. Free refreshments are served for 20 minutes beforehand - come and grab a coffee. Most of us come dressed casually, but if you want to wear a brand new suit, that's fine!

        %p
          We meet at the
          %a{:href => '#wv-find-us'} Vineyard Centre.
          We have a fully accessible venue with free parking including Blue Badge holder spaces.

        %p Many of us struggle with the effects of the past - either things we've done which we wished we hadn’t, or things we've experienced through circumstances or relationships. God loves us and wants us to be free from the things that hold us back.
        %p Life groups and Sunday morning services are a great place to be prayed for. If you want to go deeper there are a variety of different options which are collectively called Streams of Hope.
