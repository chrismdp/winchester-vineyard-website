        %h1 sundays - what to expect
        %p We start about 10:30am, but most people come along about 15 to 20 minutes early for a cup of proper coffee. The kids groups open for check in about 10:20am.

        %h3 we start with worship
        %img{:src => '/images/photos/areas/sunday/worship.jpg'}
        %p We always have a live band playing music for about 30 minutes at the beginning of the service. They play a mixture of loud and quiet contemporary songs and hymns. The words are shown on a screen: feel free to join in, or sit and watch if you prefer.
      .col-md-4
        %h3 learn together
        %img{:src => '/images/photos/areas/sunday/insight.jpg'}
        %p
          After the music, there's a talk given by someone in the church or a visiting speaker based on the bible. It's not just theory: there's always ways to apply what's being shared to our day to day lives.

        %p We finish up around noon, when parents collect their younger kids from their groups. We serve lovely cakes and nice coffee or teas and have a large cafÃ© area for everyone to hang out. People often stick around for almost an hour to chat!

        %p Jesus of Nazareth was a working-class carpenter from a dusty town in the Middle East. He was born around two thousand years ago.
        %p We believe that he was unique, and special among all people to have walked the earth: that he was God in human form.
        %p He came willingly to be with us to pay the cost of humanity's selfishness and disobedience, allowing himself to be brutally executed by the authorities that we might once again have relationship with God.
        %p We believe that he's still alive today, and calling all people to himself to join his mission to save humanity.
