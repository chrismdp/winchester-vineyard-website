        %h1 sundays - what to expect
        %p You are really welcome to join us on a Sunday morning whether you are a church 'regular' or have never been before. Our service starts at 10.30am and finishes at 12 noon. Free refreshments are served for 20 minutes beforehand - come and grab a coffee. Most of us come dressed casually, but if you want to wear a brand new suit, that's fine!

        %p
          We meet at the
          %a{:href => '#wv-find-us'} Vineyard Centre.
          We have a fully accessible venue with free parking including Blue Badge holder spaces.

        %img{:src => '/images/photos/areas/sunday/insight.jpg'}
        %p
          We have a talk based on the Bible and our experience of Jesus. It's not just theory; the talks are relevant to our day to day lives and there are always things to put into practice.

        %p At the end of the talk we reflect on what we have heard and respond. There is the opportunity to choose to follow Jesus at this time, or the chance to receive prayer. There is no pressure to participate, but always the chance to respond if you wish.

        %p Jesus of Nazareth was a working-class carpenter from a dusty town in the Middle East. He was born around two thousand years ago.
        %p We believe that he was unique, and special among all people to have walked the earth: that he was God in human form.
        %p He came willingly to be with us to pay the cost of humanity's selfishness and disobedience, allowing himself to be brutally executed by the authorities that we might once again have relationship with God.
        %p We believe that he's still alive today, and calling all people to himself to join his mission to save humanity.
