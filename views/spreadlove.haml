          As the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread, we want to be a church who intentionally step out as scattered servants to spread love to people who may be in need in our communities â€“ some may be self-isolating because they are showing symptoms of the virus or others because they are vulnerable to the effects. We have designed a simple flyer that you can print at home to fill in your details on, to then post to neighbours that lets them know you are willing to help them out in a variety of ways. As well as this there is space for your phone number, so it is easy for them to get in contact with you.
