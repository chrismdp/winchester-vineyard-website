          %h2 worship fully
          %p
            It's easy to get distracted from the real meaning of Christmas. Choose to put your focus on Jesus this advent.
          %p
            %b Idea:
            scroll down the page and see lots of different ways of worshipping fully this Christmas.

          %h2 spend less
          %p ...on gifts that don't mean a lot or won't be remembered next year. It saves time shopping and can reduce anxiety and the worry of debt.
          %p
            %b Idea:
            have a gift limit with friends so that spending doesn't get out of hand or agree in advance who you'll buy for and who you won't.

          %h2 give more
          %p God gave all. He gave himself. He gave His presence. How can we give more of ourselves this Christmas?
          %p
            %b Idea:
            spend time visiting extended family, or plan an activity to do together rather than 'just' buying a gift.
          %p
            %b Idea:
            make something meaningful to give away.

          %h2 love all
          %p By spending a little less on gifts we can free up resources to love as Jesus loves and give to those who really need help.
          %p
            %b Idea:
            as well as the Christmas compassion projects, we are having a special collection at our Christmas services for
            %a{:href => 'http://water.cc'} Living Water International.
            Let's see if the money we save by spending less can buy the gift of clean water for those dying of water related diseases.
