          John Wimber, founder of the Vineyard movement, once said: 
          ‘I want to grow up before I grow old. Initial conversion doesn’t ensure Christian maturity. We must be willing to patiently submit to and cooperate aggressively with the process of discipleship, understanding that there are no shortcuts to maturity.’

          DY is a year tailored towards serving God in a variety of ways and being encouraged to step out of your comfort zone. In doing this we see time and time again how God teaches us about His character, and our own, and shows us where we need to become more like Jesus. Our God is a relational God and He calls us to be relational people. We hope that during DY we will build a community within the group, based on trust and a common desire to grow and go deeper with God. DY also provides an excellent opportunity to explore God’s calling for your life.

          DY 2017/18 - “It was an honour to serve the local community and beyond in a variety of ways during my time on DY; including helping with The Storehouse, the Toy Fair and the Christmas Hampers. There were opportunities to explore evangelism and outreach at The Christmas Market and treasure hunting in the city. My highlight was the Romania Mission trip, which inspired me and deepened my passion to reach out to the broken, vulnerable and lost. I also loved getting involved in Kids Church and watching the children flourish as unique individuals, especially when they connect with God through worship, prayer and encourage one another. It’s so exciting!”

          DY 2017/2018 - “I spent my placement focusing on justice; discovering what the bible says about justice, what acting in a just way looks like in a commercial world and what we can do to improve the effects of that for people and our planet. I have enjoyed learning more about church life, the journey of Vineyard as a movement and the future visions for the Vineyard tribe. Personally this has been an amazing time of growth in my faith and relationship with God but I’ve also really appreciated the opportunity to spend time studying a subject I’m so passion about.”

          DY 2017/2018 - “I really enjoyed DY as it was a great opportunity to explore ministry, whilst also receiving teaching and input from the fab team at Winchester Vineyard. I focused on student ministry, and even though I grew a lot through it, God used some of the everyday bits of life to really speak to me. It was a crucial year for releasing me into my calling and passions to see people connecting with Jesus and the church. I learnt a lot about myself and God, and have grown in confidence in who God is, who I am and what He has made me to do.”
