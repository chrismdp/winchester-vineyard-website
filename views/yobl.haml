          In our Year of Biblical Literacy we want to encourage you to engage thoughtfully with the Bible in personal & communal environments and to  give you practical tools to help you grow in the practice of reading the Bible.
        %p
          We hope this will help you to grasp the overarching narrative sweep of the whole Bible, gain confidence in the Bible’s teaching and understand that the whole Bible is inspired, God breathed & useful.

          All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. - 2 Tim 3:16-17

          The personal layer is about learning the Scriptures through a daily commitment to opening your heart and mind to God through the spiritual discipline of Bible reading.

          %h3 reading scripture
          The bulk of your time during the Year of Biblical Literacy (YOBL) will be spent reading the Scriptures. The reading plan usually consists of a few chapters of a given book of the Bible + 1 Psalm. Most of the daily readings take around 30 minutes to finish. Some might prefer to break up their reading throughout the day, reading one chapter in the morning and one chapter in the evening. It is important to find the pace that works best for you given your schedule, commitments and the natural limitations of your life. The point of YOBL is not to rush through Scripture to say you finished in a year but to become more biblically literate, and thus, more formed by the Bible in your relationship with God. If this means taking it slower (or faster) than the reading plan suggests, please do so.

          %h3 reading scripture videos
          The Bible Project has created beautifully illustrated introductory videos to every book in the Bible as well as some of the major themes in Scripture. These videos give you a roadmap of what is going on in a given book, the historical context, and what to look for or notice while you’re reading. The videos are meant to be both an introduction and a reference to supplement your reading. In some ways, the Read Scripture videos are the easiest part of YOBL to incorporate and keep up within your day to day life.The personal layer is about learning the Scriptures through a daily commitment to opening your heart and mind to God through the spiritual discipline of Bible reading.

          The communal layer is about experiencing Scripture together.
        %p  
          The Bible is a communal book. It was meant to be read and discussed in community with others. We want to encourage you to do this in your life group or in a small study group with 3 or 4 friends - to help distill a week’s reading into a time of connection, prayer, and discussion with others who are also going through YOBL. These groups are to share, grow and pray together as you study the Bible and develop deeper connections with Jesus and with each other. If you need help forming a group you can journey with over the coming year, please let us know as we would love to help you.

          technique which you might be familiar with already. We will also be providing study materials to reinforce the Sunday YOBL teaching and themes.

          The worshipful layer is about experiencing God in Scripture and worship on a Sunday.
        %p
          Our Sunday teachings over the coming year will loosely follow the daily reading plan so we will be teaching out of a similar place to where you will be in the readings throughout the year.
        %p
          By doing this, we hope to be able to provide everyone with greater context to the story of God in parts of the Bible that are often overlooked, taken out of context, or dismissed.

          For those who want to, there will be some more in depth theology talks with guest speakers from time to time, and one or two Vineyard Institute (VI) groups working through specific theology modules within a small learning community.
