          We believe that that the Bible is a really important book. It’s vital to help us get to know Jesus better, but it can sometimes be challenging to read and understand. Throughout 2019, we are learning to engage thoughtfully with the Bible through reading it personally and as we gather together. We want to grasp the overarching story of the whole Bible as well as to work out how to understand it better and apply it to our lives.

          If you are not a regular Bible reader or just aren’t keen on reading, don’t worry! There are tools to help you. What we are setting out to do is a big task but doing it together will help!

          "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work." - 2 Tim 3:16-17. John Wimber, the founder of the Vineyard Movement said “Its not just about being Biblically literate, we must also become biblically obedient."

          The Sunday layer is about experiencing the Bible as part of our Sunday worship 
        %p 
          Our teaching series over the coming year will loosely follow the READ SCRIPTURE plan, focussing on certain books and reflecting particular themes.  Our aim is to explore the story of God through parts of the Bible that are often overlooked, taken out of context, or dismissed. 
        %p 
          Series coming up in 2019 include: The Good Book (An intro to the bible & authority), The Big Story of God (an overview of the whole bible), Symbols of Christ, Understanding the Old Testament: Violence, Sex, Judgement & Evil, The School of Life (Book of Job), Song of Solomon, Thriving in Exile (Book of Daniel), The Character of Jesus, Love & Unity (Ephesians), Leadership in the Church (Timothy), Faith in Practise (James).

          The Life Group layer is about experiencing the Bible together in a small group. 
        %p  
          The Bible is a communal book. It was meant to be read and discussed in community with others. We want to encourage you to do this in your Life Group or in a small study group with 3 or 4 friends - to help distill a week’s reading into a time of connection, prayer, and discussion with others who are also going through YOBL. 
        %p  
          These groups are to share, grow and pray together as you study the Bible and develop deeper connections with Jesus and one another. We will be providing study materials to support the Sunday YOBL teaching and themes.
